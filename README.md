# aws-lambda-scripts
two useful lambda scripts that help creating ec2 instances from a dynamo db (by reading instructions from it) 
and also one that creates a snapshot before an ec2 instance is terminated 
(To prevent the feeling of anger and frustration when you realize what you just might have done :) )

I have created both after taking a linuxacademy course on AWS Lambda. 
Please let me know if there are any questions on the functionality of the scripts!
